# Security Policy — rally

## Supported versions

Rally is pre-1.0 and has not cut a tagged release yet. Security fixes land on
`main`; test against the latest commit and report the SHA you used.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.** Instead:

1. Open a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/GrayCodeAI/rally/security/advisories/new), **or**
2. Email `security@graycodeai.com` with the details below.

Include in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and the affected component.
- Steps to reproduce, ideally with a minimal proof-of-concept.
- The commit SHA you tested against.
- The potential impact and any suggested mitigation.

**Response targets:**

- Initial acknowledgement: within **48 hours**.
- Triage and severity assessment: within **5 business days**.
- Coordinated fix and disclosure: within **30 days** for high/critical, **90
  days** for medium/low (per industry-standard responsible disclosure).

## Disclosure policy

We follow [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure):

- Reporters receive credit in the advisory and `CHANGELOG.md` (unless they opt
  out).
- We ask that reporters refrain from public disclosure until a fix has been
  released or the disclosure deadline above has elapsed.
- We will not pursue legal action against good-faith researchers acting
  within this policy.

## Security practices in this repo

- **Standard library only:** there are no third-party Go dependencies, so the
  dependency surface is limited to the Go toolchain itself.
- **CI checks:** `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `go test -race` run on every push and
  pull request.
- **No secrets required:** the project needs no API keys or credentials, and
  none are stored in the repository.
- **Loopback-only API:** the HTTP server binds to `127.0.0.1` and has no
  authentication. Do not expose it through a reverse proxy or a public
  interface.
- **Bounded input:** request bodies are limited to 1 MiB, unknown JSON fields
  are rejected, and the server makes no outbound network or model calls.
- **Private storage:** data is written as individual `0600` JSON files inside a
  `0700` directory.

## Scope

This policy covers the code in this repository and the build artefacts
published from it. It does not cover third-party tools or services, or misuse
by someone who already has shell access to the machine.
